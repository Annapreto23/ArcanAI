# 🧙‍♀️ ArcanAI

**ArcanAI** is a small Streamlit app that mixes tarot reading with AI interpretation.
Ask a question, pick a spread, draw your cards, and get an automated reading powered by OpenAI.

## Run the app

```bash
streamlit run ArcanAI_streamlit_app.py
```

Make sure your **OpenAI API key** is set in your environment:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

or add it in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`.
